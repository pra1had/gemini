# Active Context

## What You're Working On Now

The primary focus has been enhancing the `ActionCodeService` to provide more robust OpenAPI schema processing and ensuring tests pass.

## Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Initialized:** All required `cline_docs/` files were created and populated.
*   **Path Validation Added:** Implemented validation in `ActionCodeService.java` to ensure each processed OpenAPI schema contains exactly one path, logging a warning and skipping if not. (File: `scenario-builder/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/service/ActionCodeService.java`)
*   **Response Body Processing Implemented:**
    *   Created `ResponseBodyColumnInfo.java` DTO. (File: `scenario-builder/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/dto/ResponseBodyColumnInfo.java`)
    *   Added `responseBodyColumnList` field to `ActionCodeInfo.java` DTO. (File: `scenario-builder/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/dto/ActionCodeInfo.java`)
    *   Added `processResponseBody` method to `ActionCodeService.java` to extract and flatten response schemas (checking 200, 201, and default status codes).
    *   Refactored schema flattening logic into a generic `flattenSchemaGeneric` method in `ActionCodeService.java` to handle both request and response bodies.
    *   Updated `processRequestBody` in `ActionCodeService.java` to use the new generic flattening method.
*   **Test Fix:** Ran `mvn test`, identified a failure in `ActionCodeServiceTest.testGenerateActionCodeList` related to the `mandatory` flag in `responseBodyColumnList`. Fixed the issue in `ActionCodeService.java` by setting `mandatory` to `false` for response fields within `flattenSchemaGeneric`. Re-ran tests, which now pass. (File: `scenario-builder/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/service/ActionCodeService.java`)

## Next Steps

1.  Update `cline_docs/progress.md` to reflect the test fix and passing status.
2.  Await further instructions or tasks from the user after memory bank update is complete.
