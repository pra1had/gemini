# Active Context

## Backend Service (`backend/`)

### What You're Working On Now (Backend)

The primary focus has been enhancing the `ActionCodeService` to provide more robust OpenAPI schema processing and ensuring tests pass. No immediate active development tasks are assigned, pending further requirements or verification steps outlined in `progress.md`.

### Recent Changes (Backend)

*   **Memory Bank Initialized:** All required `cline_docs/` files were created and populated initially (covering only backend).
*   **Path Validation Added:** Implemented validation in `ActionCodeService.java` to ensure each processed OpenAPI schema contains exactly one path, logging a warning and skipping if not. (File: `backend/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/service/ActionCodeService.java`)
*   **Response Body Processing Implemented:**
    *   Created `ResponseBodyColumnInfo.java` DTO. (File: `backend/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/dto/ResponseBodyColumnInfo.java`)
    *   Added `responseBodyColumnList` field to `ActionCodeInfo.java` DTO. (File: `backend/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/dto/ActionCodeInfo.java`)
    *   Added `processResponseBody` method to `ActionCodeService.java` to extract and flatten response schemas (checking 200, 201, and default status codes).
    *   Refactored schema flattening logic into a generic `flattenSchemaGeneric` method in `ActionCodeService.java` to handle both request and response bodies.
    *   Updated `processRequestBody` in `ActionCodeService.java` to use the new generic flattening method.
*   **Test Fix:** Ran `mvn test`, identified a failure in `ActionCodeServiceTest.testGenerateActionCodeList` related to the `mandatory` flag in `responseBodyColumnList`. Fixed the issue in `ActionCodeService.java` by setting `mandatory` to `false` for response fields within `flattenSchemaGeneric`. Re-ran tests, which now pass. (File: `backend/src/main/java/com/infosys/fbp/platform/actioncode/service/ActionCodeService.java`)
*   **Grid Path Redesign (Backend):**
    *   Added `attributePath` and `attributeGridPath` fields to `RequestBodyColumnInfo.java` and `ResponseBodyColumnInfo.java`.
    *   Updated `ActionCodeService.java` (`flattenSchemaGeneric` method) to populate these fields as `derivedDataType + ":" + technicalColumnName`.
    *   Updated test data JSONs (`ActionCodeList.json`, `ActionCodeList_complexSchema.json`) with expected values for the new fields.
    *   Ran `mvn test` successfully, confirming backend changes.

### Next Steps (Backend)

1.  Implement Phase 2 tasks from `docs/plan.md`:
    *   Implement health check endpoint (`/health`).
    *   Implement Temporary Persistence (define model, implement storage, create save/load endpoints).
2.  Address remaining verification and testing items listed in `progress.md` (e.g., HTTP client config, complex schema testing, integration tests).
3.  Await further specific instructions or tasks from the user.

## Frontend Application (`src/`) - Scenario Workbench UI

### What You're Working On Now (Frontend)

Phase 1 (UI Foundation & Core Flow) is largely complete. The immediate focus shifts to starting Phase 2 tasks.

### Recent Changes (Frontend)

*   **Phase 1 Completion:** Implemented core UI layout (`Layout.tsx`), routing (`/`, `/create`, `/edit`), state management setup (`scenarioStore.ts` with mocks), and core scenario flow interactions (`CreateEditPageComponent.tsx`, `SortableStepItem.tsx` - add/remove/reorder/expand steps using mock data).
*   **Basic Grid Placeholder:** Created `StepDataGrid.tsx` as a placeholder.
*   **Memory Bank Update:** All `cline_docs/` files were updated to include frontend context based on `docs/` files and `package.json`.
*   **Grid Path Redesign (Frontend):**
    *   Updated `StepDataGrid.tsx` (`generateGridColumns` function) to use `attributePath` for the column `field` ID and `attributeGridPath` for the `headerName`.
    *   Updated `scenarioStore.ts` type definitions (`RequestBodyColumnInfo`, `ResponseBodyColumnInfo`) to include the optional `attributePath` and `attributeGridPath` fields, resolving TypeScript errors.

### Next Steps (Frontend - Continuing Phase 2)

1.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   Connect `src/services/apiClient.ts` to the *actual* backend endpoints (`/health`, `/api/actions`, temporary save/load).
    *   Fetch and display the *real* Action List from the backend (`/api/actions`) (US-002).
2.  **Grid Enhancement (US-005 Revised):**
    *   Implement remaining core grid features: keyboard navigation, copy/paste.
3.  **Temporary Persistence:** Connect the UI state to temporary backend save/load endpoints once they become available.
4.  **Authentication & Authorization (Initial Setup - US-012):**
    *   Clarify user identification mechanism.
    *   Implement basic backend middleware and frontend logic for placeholder roles.

## Overall Next Steps

1.  Focus on **Phase 2** development as outlined in the updated `docs/plan.md`, coordinating frontend and backend tasks:
    *   **Backend:** Implement `/health` endpoint and Temporary Persistence. Address verification/testing items.
    *   **Frontend:** Implement Backend Integration, complete Grid Enhancements (keyboard nav, copy/paste), and start Auth setup.
2.  Await further specific instructions or tasks from the user.
