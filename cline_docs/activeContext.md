# Active Context

## Current Development Phase

The project is currently in **Phase 2: Backend Integration & Grid Enhancement**, with Phase 1 (UI Foundation & Core Flow) largely complete.

## Backend Service (`backend/`)

### What You're Working On Now (Backend)

The primary focus is completing Phase 2 tasks and addressing verification items:

1. **Temporary Persistence Layer:**
   - Implemented DTOs: `ScenarioDto`, `ScenarioStepDto`, `ScenarioStepDataDto`
   - Created `ScenarioPersistenceService` with in-memory storage
   - Created `ScenarioPersistenceController` with save/load endpoints
   - Added unit and integration tests

2. **Health Endpoint:**
   - Implemented `HealthController` with `/health` endpoint
   - Added integration tests

3. **Grid Path Enhancement:**
   - Added `attributePath` and `attributeGridPath` fields to DTOs
   - Updated `ActionCodeService` flattening logic
   - Updated test data and verified tests pass

### Recent Changes (Backend)

1. **Core Service Enhancements:**
   - Implemented path validation in `ActionCodeService`
   - Added response body processing with `ResponseBodyColumnInfo`
   - Refactored schema flattening into generic method
   - Fixed mandatory flag handling for response fields

2. **Temporary Persistence:**
   - Added scenario persistence DTOs and service
   - Implemented in-memory storage with `ConcurrentHashMap`
   - Created REST endpoints for save/load
   - Added comprehensive tests

3. **Health Check:**
   - Added `/health` endpoint returning `{"status": "UP"}`
   - Added integration tests

### Next Steps (Backend)

1. **Verification Tasks:**
   - Verify HTTP client configuration in `RestClientConfig`
   - Test complex schema handling in `flattenSchemaGeneric`
   - Expand integration tests for `/api/actions`
   - Implement robust error handling

2. **Phase 3 Preparation:**
   - Plan Markdown generation/parsing implementation
   - Design Excel export service
   - Update persistence to use Markdown format

## Frontend Application (`src/`)

### What You're Working On Now (Frontend)

The focus is on Phase 2 tasks, particularly backend integration and grid enhancement:

1. **Backend Integration:**
   - Connected to `/api/actions` endpoint
   - Implemented health check integration
   - Added temporary persistence integration

2. **Grid Enhancement:**
   - Updated grid to use `attributePath`/`attributeGridPath`
   - Implemented basic keyboard navigation
   - Added spreadsheet-compatible copy/paste

### Recent Changes (Frontend)

1. **Backend Integration:**
   - Updated `apiClient.ts` with health check and persistence endpoints
   - Modified store to handle real backend data
   - Added scenario ID handling in UI

2. **Grid Enhancements:**
   - Updated `StepDataGrid` to use new path attributes
   - Added spreadsheet copy/paste compatibility
   - Implemented data validation feedback

3. **Store Updates:**
   - Added scenario persistence actions
   - Updated types for backend DTOs
   - Added health check state management

### Next Steps (Frontend)

1. **Phase 2 Completion:**
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Enhance grid keyboard navigation
   - Implement advanced copy/paste features

2. **Phase 3 Preparation:**
   - Design Review view component
   - Plan Excel export UI integration
   - Prepare for Markdown-based persistence

## Overall Next Steps

1. **Phase 2 Completion:**
   - Backend: Complete verification tasks
   - Frontend: Finish grid enhancements
   - Both: Implement comprehensive error handling

2. **Phase 3 Planning:**
   - Design Markdown generation/parsing approach
   - Plan Excel export implementation
   - Design Review view workflow

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update API documentation
   - Document grid features
   - Create user guides for completed features

4. **Testing:**
   - Expand backend integration tests
   - Add frontend unit tests
   - Plan E2E test implementation
