## What Works

*   **Project Structure:** The basic Java/Spring Boot project structure within `scenario-builder/` is set up.
*   **Core Components (File Presence):**
    *   `ActionCodeController.java` exists.
    *   `ActionCodeService.java` exists.
    *   DTO classes (`ActionCodeInfo`, `ComponentDetail`, `ParameterInfo`, `PathPropertyListMap`, `RequestBodyColumnInfo`, `ResponseBodyColumnInfo`, `ApiListManifest`) exist in the `*.dto` package.
*   **Dependencies:** The required `swagger-parser` dependency is included in `pom.xml`.
*   **Basic Configuration:** `application.properties` and logging properties exist.
*   **Initial Tests:** An `ActionCodeServiceTest.java` file exists.
*   **Path Validation:** `ActionCodeService` validates that each schema has exactly one path.
*   **Request/Response Body Processing:**
    *   `ActionCodeService` includes logic (`flattenSchemaGeneric`, `processRequestBody`, `processResponseBody`) to flatten both request and response body schemas found in OpenAPI specs (handling 200, 201, default responses). The logic correctly handles the `mandatory` flag for response fields (setting it to `false`).
    *   `ActionCodeInfo` DTO includes lists for both flattened request and response columns.
*   **Core Service Tests Passing:** The unit tests in `ActionCodeServiceTest.java` (using `MockRestServiceServer` for HTTP mocking) are passing, verifying the core logic for manifest/schema fetching, parsing, path validation, and request/response body flattening against the defined test cases.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

1.  **Implement HTTP Client Configuration:**
    *   Add properties to `application.properties` for the *actual* manifest URL and potentially base URLs for schemas (currently uses test URLs).
    *   Verify the `RestTemplate` bean configuration in `RestClientConfig.java` is suitable for production use (e.g., timeouts, error handling).
2.  **Verify Service Logic (`ActionCodeService`):**
    *   Confirm correct fetching/parsing of manifest/schemas against *real* endpoints (if available) or more complex mocks.
    *   Verify accurate extraction/mapping of all fields against the specification in `productContext.md` with potentially more complex real-world schemas.
    *   **Further verify the implementation of the recursive request and response body flattening logic** (`flattenSchemaGeneric`) handles *more complex* nested structures, arrays (e.g., arrays of objects, arrays of arrays), and `$ref` resolution edge cases beyond the current test coverage.
3.  **Verify Controller Logic (`ActionCodeController`):**
    *   Confirm the `@GetMapping("/action-codes")` endpoint is correctly defined and functional.
    *   Ensure it calls the `ActionCodeService` and returns the results appropriately serialized as JSON.
4.  **Verify DTOs:** Ensure the DTO structures accurately reflect the target JSON output format specified in the *final* expected output definition (e.g., compare with `docs/ActionCodeList.json` if that's the definitive source).
5.  **Testing:**
    *   **Expand `ActionCodeServiceTest.java`:** Add more test cases covering diverse schema structures (e.g., deeper nesting, different array types, more complex refs), network edge cases (timeouts, different HTTP errors), and parsing edge cases.
    *   **Implement Integration Tests:** Create integration tests for the `/action-codes` endpoint to verify the full flow from HTTP request to response, potentially using `MockRestServiceServer` or WireMock for external dependencies.
6.  **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling is implemented and tested for HTTP client errors (timeouts, connection issues, 4xx/5xx responses) and parsing errors throughout the service and controller layers.

## Progress Status

*   **Core Functionality Implemented & Tested:** The basic code structure is present. The core logic in `ActionCodeService` (manifest/schema fetching & parsing, path validation, request/response body flattening) is implemented and verified by passing unit tests (`ActionCodeServiceTest.java` using `MockRestServiceServer`).
*   **Verification Needed:** HTTP client configuration (`RestTemplate` bean in `RestClientConfig.java`), controller logic (`ActionCodeController`), DTO alignment with the final expected output (`docs/ActionCodeList.json`), and end-to-end integration still require verification and potentially implementation/refinement.
*   **Testing Needs Expansion:** While core service tests pass, they need expansion to cover more complex scenarios and edge cases. Integration tests for the controller endpoint are still needed.
