# Progress

## Backend Service (`backend/`)

### What Works

*   **Project Structure:** The basic Java/Spring Boot project structure within `backend/` is set up.
*   **Core Components (File Presence):**
    *   `ActionCodeController.java` exists.
    *   `ActionCodeService.java` exists.
    *   DTO classes (`ActionCodeInfo`, `ComponentDetail`, `ParameterInfo`, `PathPropertyListMap`, `RequestBodyColumnInfo`, `ResponseBodyColumnInfo`, `ApiListManifest`) exist in the `*.dto` package.
*   **Dependencies:** The required `swagger-parser` dependency is included in `pom.xml`.
*   **Basic Configuration:** `application.properties` and logging properties exist.
*   **Initial Tests:** An `ActionCodeServiceTest.java` file exists.
*   **Path Validation:** `ActionCodeService` validates that each schema has exactly one path.
*   **Request/Response Body Processing:**
    *   `ActionCodeService` includes logic (`flattenSchemaGeneric`, `processRequestBody`, `processResponseBody`) to flatten both request and response body schemas found in OpenAPI specs (handling 200, 201, default responses). The logic correctly handles the `mandatory` flag for response fields (setting it to `false`).
    *   `ActionCodeInfo` DTO includes lists for both flattened request and response columns.
*   **Grid Path Redesign:**
    *   Added `attributePath` and `attributeGridPath` fields to `RequestBodyColumnInfo` and `ResponseBodyColumnInfo` DTOs.
    *   Updated `ActionCodeService` to populate these fields.
    *   Updated test data JSONs (`ActionCodeList.json`, `ActionCodeList_complexSchema.json`) with expected values.
*   **Core Service Tests Passing:** The unit tests in `ActionCodeServiceTest.java` (using `MockRestServiceServer` for HTTP mocking) are passing, including tests covering the grid path redesign changes.

### What's Left to Build / Verify (Backend)

1.  **Implement HTTP Client Configuration:**
    *   Add properties to `application.properties` for the *actual* manifest URL and potentially base URLs for schemas (currently uses test URLs).
    *   Verify the `RestTemplate` bean configuration in `RestClientConfig.java` is suitable for production use (e.g., timeouts, error handling).
2.  **Verify Service Logic (`ActionCodeService`):**
    *   Confirm correct fetching/parsing of manifest/schemas against *real* endpoints (if available) or more complex mocks.
    *   Verify accurate extraction/mapping of all fields against the specification in `productContext.md` with potentially more complex real-world schemas.
    *   **Further verify the implementation of the recursive request and response body flattening logic** (`flattenSchemaGeneric`) handles *more complex* nested structures, arrays (e.g., arrays of objects, arrays of arrays), and `$ref` resolution edge cases beyond the current test coverage.
3.  **Verify Controller Logic (`ActionCodeController`):**
    *   Confirm the `@GetMapping("/api/actions")` endpoint is correctly defined and functional.
    *   Ensure it calls the `ActionCodeService` and returns the results appropriately serialized as JSON.
4.  **Verify DTOs:** Ensure the DTO structures accurately reflect the target JSON output format specified in the *final* expected output definition (e.g., compare with `docs/resources/ActionCodeList.json` if that's the definitive source).
5.  **Testing:**
    *   **Expand `ActionCodeServiceTest.java`:** Add more test cases covering diverse schema structures (e.g., deeper nesting, different array types, more complex refs), network edge cases (timeouts, different HTTP errors), and parsing edge cases.
    *   **Implement Integration Tests:** Create integration tests for the `/api/actions` endpoint to verify the full flow from HTTP request to response, potentially using `MockRestServiceServer` or WireMock for external dependencies.
6.  **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling is implemented and tested for HTTP client errors (timeouts, connection issues, 4xx/5xx responses) and parsing errors throughout the service and controller layers.

### Progress Status (Backend)

*   **Core Functionality Implemented & Tested:** The basic code structure is present. The core logic in `ActionCodeService` (manifest/schema fetching & parsing, path validation, request/response body flattening, grid path generation) is implemented and verified by passing unit tests (`ActionCodeServiceTest.java` using `MockRestServiceServer`).
*   **Verification Needed:** HTTP client configuration (`RestTemplate` bean in `RestClientConfig.java`), controller logic (`ActionCodeController`), and end-to-end integration still require verification and potentially implementation/refinement. DTO alignment with the final expected output is confirmed via updated test data JSONs.
*   **Testing Needs Expansion:** While core service tests pass, they need expansion to cover more complex scenarios and edge cases not covered by the current test data. Integration tests for the controller endpoint are still needed.

## Frontend Application (`src/`) - Scenario Workbench UI

### What Works (Based on `docs/plan.md` Phase 1 & File Structure)

*   **Project Setup:** Next.js (App Router), Material UI, Zustand, ESLint configured. Basic `src/` structure exists.
*   **Frontend Foundation:**
    *   Client-side routing via App Router (`/`, `/create`, `/edit/[scenarioId]`).
    *   Zustand store (`scenarioStore.ts`) set up for state management (using mock data initially).
    *   Main application layout component (`Layout.tsx`) created.
*   **Scenario Building UI (Core Flow - US-001, US-003, US-004):**
    *   "Create Scenario" placeholder route (`/create`) exists.
    *   Main Create/Edit page component (`CreateEditPageComponent.tsx`) exists, acting as the "Your Flow" panel container.
    *   Adding Actions (from mock list in store) to the flow implemented (via click).
    *   Reordering steps using `dnd-kit` implemented (`SortableStepItem.tsx`).
    *   Removing steps implemented (delete button).
    *   Inline expansion/collapse for steps implemented.
*   **Step Data Entry UI (Basic Grid - Part of US-005):**
    *   Basic grid component (`StepDataGrid.tsx`) exists and renders dynamically based on action schema.
    *   Includes data binding, add/remove rows, basic validation, and uses `attributePath`/`attributeGridPath` for columns.
*   **Mock Data:** Mock Action List and Scenario structure defined in Zustand store (`scenarioStore.ts`).
*   **Grid Path Redesign:** Updated `StepDataGrid.tsx` and `scenarioStore.ts` types to use `attributePath` and `attributeGridPath`.

### What's Left to Build / Verify (Frontend - Primarily Phase 2 onwards)

1.  **Backend Integration (Phase 2):**
    *   Connect `apiClient.ts` to *actual* backend endpoints (`/health`, `/api/actions`, save/load/export).
    *   Fetch and display the *real* Action List from `/api/actions` (US-002).
    *   Connect UI state to backend persistence (initially temporary, then Git via backend).
2.  **Step Data Entry UI (Grid Enhancement - Phase 2 - US-005 Revised):**
    *   Implement keyboard navigation.
    *   Implement copy/paste functionality.
3.  **Markdown/Excel Features (Phase 3):**
    *   Implement "Export" button and connect to backend endpoint (US-011).
    *   Verify save/load uses Markdown format via backend.
4.  **Git Integration & Final Features (Phase 4):**
    *   Implement final Search page UI and connect to backend search endpoint (US-008).
    *   Connect "Edit" button on Search page to load scenario (US-009).
    *   Implement "Duplicate" scenario flow (US-010).
    *   Implement final "Create Scenario" metadata UI (US-001).
    *   Implement "Review" view/navigation (US-006).
    *   Implement final "Save" button on Review view, connect to backend save endpoint, handle success/error (US-007).
    *   Implement role-based UI restrictions (US-012).
    *   Implement first-time user experience/tooltips (PRD 5.1).
5.  **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests.

### Progress Status (Frontend)

*   **Phase 1 Complete:** The core UI foundation, layout, routing, state management (with mocks), and basic scenario flow interactions (add, remove, reorder, expand/collapse steps) are implemented.
*   **Grid Component Enhanced (Phase 2):** The `StepDataGrid` component now dynamically renders columns based on action schema using `attributePath`/`attributeGridPath`, supports data binding, add/remove rows, and basic validation. Keyboard navigation and copy/paste are pending.
*   **Backend Connection Pending:** The frontend currently uses mock data and needs to be connected to the backend API endpoints (Phase 2).
*   **Advanced Features Pending:** Markdown/Excel generation, Git integration, final search/save/load/duplicate flows, and role-based access are planned for later phases.
